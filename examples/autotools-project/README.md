Lily-Engine-Utils Examples
--------------------------

This project is going to serve as some example code (both for build
systems *and* for C++ code). Right now it's just an autotools example
project.

Future intent is to add it to the Lily-Engine-Utils main repository.
Right now it lives outside of that, and requires a copy of
Lily-Engine-Utils to be checked out inside of it. Git submodules are
annoying, so just run this to fetch it:

```bash
git clone https://git.intoxicoding.com/Intoxicoding/Lily-Engine-Utils.git
```

Alternatively, run this if you have ssh access to Lily-Engine-Utils:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@git.intoxicoding.com:8002/Intoxicoding/Lily-Engine-Utils.git
```
