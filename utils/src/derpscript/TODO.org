* For DerpScript speed:
** TODO Add hashes to pooledstring class
** TODO Make variable lookups in DerpScript use hashtables
** TODO Make a hash function that just returns the hash from pooledstring
** TODO Make pooledstring more complete, so it can do mostly everything that a std::string can do (maybe)
** TODO PooledMemory for EVERYTHING
- Grep for everything that does a "new DerpObject" and swap it out
  with a call to the VM's makeObject() function.

- For some things, we don't want a reference returned, so maybe a
  makeObject() variant that just returns a pointer. Things like
  DerpObjects that exist as part of DerpExecNode hierarchies, which
  don't rely on refcounts for the GC. (These are created during
  parsing.)

* For DerpScript security:
** DONE Add recursion limit with error
** TODO Add execution limit
Just count down the number of eval() calls and error out when it runs
out.

* For DerpScript future:
** TODO Add exceptions? We already have the return modes for errors and other
** TODO Maybe even replace errors with exceptions entirely

* For DerpScript REPL:
** TODO Autocomplete
- Will need a read-only VM mode
  - All const checks result in const
  - All protected checks result in protected
    - Should be done as a stack
    - Add safety check to stack top

- Use curses.h under *nix.
  - Has getch().
