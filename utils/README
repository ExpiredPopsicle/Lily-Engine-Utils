  How to use this library (for now).
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This library contains the basic utility library that shouldn't depend
on anything besides system libs (pthreads on *nix, the usual Windowsy
junk on Windows, sockets on both). It can be easily dropped into
existing projects and everything is in the namespace "ExPop".

The include file "utils.h" will include everything else
automatically. You can also just include headers for individual
features, but those header names may change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A Doxyfile is included in case you would like to have Doxygen generate
documentation for you. Additionally, the headers should be a mostly
legible form of reference on their own.
