* Lily Engine Utils

This is a library I've built up over years as I've worked on various
side project games, game engines, image processing tools, personal
convenience systems, and porn-gathering bots.

It does a bunch of stuff from common string manipulation operations on
std::string objects to matrix math and image manipulation. These
different tasks may be split up into individual subsystems at one
point, but at the moment it's just easier to include all of them and
let the compiler figure out what you really need.

The name comes from the old game project that the beginnings of this
collection were torn from.

** The two sections

*** Utils

The library itself is in the "utils" directory. I'm gradually working
towards the point where you can just add "everything.cpp" to your
C++11 or above project and not worry about any linking crap.

Later versions may be header-only.

Expect API breaking changes because nobody but me uses this thing
anyway.

If #including individual headers isn't your style, you can simply
#include <lilyengine/utils.h> and get everything.

config.bsh, run from the root directory of the project, will take
--libs and --cxxflags parameters, and spit back compiler flags needed
to add the library to a project. This will generate absolute paths for
header search flags, pointing them to the current Lily-Engine-Utils
directory.

*** Tools

In the "tools" directory is a commandline tools build with the
lilyengine library. It's some stuff I find useful for code generation,
issue tracking, and some image processing.

** Dependencies

The library has optional dependencies on the Windows sockets library
(ws2_32.lib, or libws2_32.a) when compiling on Windows, pthreads on
Linux, and possibly pthreads on other Unix-like systems.

Unless the relevant subsystem has been explicitly enabled, these will
not be used, and will not cause your program to require them. Here are
the #defines needed for each optional subsystem:

|---------------------------------+----------------------|
| Subsystem                       | Required #defines    |
|---------------------------------+----------------------|
| Sockets                         | EXPOP_ENABLE_SOCKETS |
| HTTP                            | EXPOP_ENABLE_SOCKETS |
| Threaded asset loader           | EXPOP_ENABLE_THREADS |
| Thread-safe console             | EXPOP_ENABLE_THREADS |
| Thread-safey for archive system | EXPOP_ENABLE_THREADS |
|---------------------------------+----------------------|

Should you enable any of these, it's up to you to fight with your
linker. Have fun!
